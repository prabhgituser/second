Git Architecture


There are four elements in sequence:


1. Working directory
2. staging Area
3. Local Repository
4. Remote Repository



1. working Directory  :  here we are doing writing and editing.

                     then we give (git add .)command and it
                     moves to


2. staging area  :  here processing done
                    after that we give (git commit -m "message")command
                     It moves to

3. Local Repository: here we give command (git push -u origin master)     
                     it moves to
4.
